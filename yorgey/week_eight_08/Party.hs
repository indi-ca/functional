-- Guest List
-- Obvious way would be [Employee]
-- But don't want to recompute Fun scores every time
-- GuestList contais both a list of Employees and a Fun score
-- Values of type GuestList should always satisfy the invariant that
-- the sum of all the Fun scores in the list of Employees should be
-- equal to the one, “cached” Fun score.

-- data GuestList = GL [Employee] Fun
--   deriving (Show, Eq)

-- instance Ord GuestList where
--   compare (GL _ f1) (GL _ f2) = compare f1 f2




-- Define tools for working with GuestLists

-- EXERCISE 1.1
-- glCons :: Employee -> GuestList -> GuestList

-- which adds an Employee to the GuestList
-- (updating the cached Fun score appropriately).
-- Of course, in general this is impossible:
-- the updated fun score should depend on whether the Employee being added is already in the list,
-- or if any of their direct subor- dinates are in the list, and so on.
-- For our purposes, though, you may assume that none of these special cases will hold:
-- that is, glCons should simply add the new Employee and add their fun score without doing any kind of checks.
