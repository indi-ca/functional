module Folds where

import Data.List


-- EXERCISE 1


-- Reimplement each of the following functions in a more idiomatic
-- Haskell style. Use wholemeal programming practices, breaking each function into a pipeline of incremental transformations to an entire data structure. Name your functions fun1’ and fun2’ respectively.

-- Hint: For this problem you may wish to use the functions iterate and takeWhile. Look them up in the Prelude documentation to see what they do.

fun1 :: [Integer] -> Integer
fun1 [] = 1
fun1 (x:xs)
     | even x    = (x - 2) * fun1 xs
     | otherwise = fun1 xs


fun2 :: Integer -> Integer
fun2 1 = 0
fun2 n  | even n     = n + fun2 (n `div` 2)
        | otherwise  = fun2 (3 * n + 1)
